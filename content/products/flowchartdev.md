## Flowchart.dev

Flowchart.dev is a modern, web-based flowchart drawing application that allows users to create professional diagrams using ANSI standard flowchart symbols. Built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas, it offers a clean, intuitive interface with powerful features like zoom controls, undo/redo functionality, and multiple export options.

## Why?

I am a great fan of draw.io and diagrams.net and this is inspired by those tools. I wanted to create a flowchart tool that is simple, fast, and easy to use, while still being powerful enough for complex diagrams. Flowchart.dev is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it perfect for quick diagramming tasks without the bloat of larger applications.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¨ ANSI Standard Flowchart Symbols
- **Process** - Rectangle for general processing steps
- **Decision** - Diamond for decision points and conditionals
- **Terminal** - Rounded rectangle for start/end points
- **Input/Output** - Parallelogram for data input/output operations
- **Document** - Document shape with wavy bottom
- **Data** - Parallelogram skewed right for data storage
- **Predefined Process** - Rectangle with vertical lines for subroutines
- **Connector** - Circle for connecting flow between pages

### ðŸ”§ Core Functionality
- **Drag & Drop Interface** - Simply drag symbols from the toolbar onto the canvas
- **Smart Connectors** - Draw arrows and lines between shapes with automatic attachment points
- **Property Editor** - Customize colors, text, and dimensions for each element
- **Zoom Controls** - Zoom in/out up to 300% with mouse wheel or buttons
- **Pan Navigation** - Navigate large diagrams with Shift+drag or middle mouse button
- **Undo/Redo** - Up to 50 levels of undo/redo history
- **Auto-Save History** - Never lose your work with automatic state management

### ðŸ“¤ Export & Sharing Options
- **PNG Export** - Download your flowchart as a high-quality PNG image
- **Embed Code** - Generate HTML, Base64, or Markdown embed codes
- **Clean Export** - Exports without UI elements or selection highlights

## Usage Guide
